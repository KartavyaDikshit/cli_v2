    3 This project is a Next.js application bootstrapped with `create-next-app`, designed to provide a robust
      foundation for modern web development. It leverages the App Router for routing, Tailwind CSS for styling,
      and `next-intl` for comprehensive internationalization. The application is configured for optimal SEO and
      includes a testing setup with Jest, Playwright, and Cypress.

   10 ## Project Structure Explained
   11 - `src/`: Contains the main application source code.
   12     - `app/`: Implements the Next.js App Router, including root layout (`layout.tsx`), global styles (
      `globals.css`), and the main entry page (`page.tsx`).
   13     - `components/`: Houses reusable React components, such as `SEOHead.tsx` for managing SEO metadata.
   14     - `hooks/`: Directory for custom React hooks.
   15     - `lib/`: Contains utility functions and configurations.
   16         - `i18n/`: Internationalization configuration using `next-intl`, defining locales and their
      settings.
   17         - `seo/`: SEO-related utilities, including `structured-data.ts` for JSON-LD generation.
   18     - `testing/`: Placeholder for testing-related files.
   19     - `types/`: TypeScript type definitions.
   20 - `public/`: Static assets served directly by Next.js (e.g., images like `next.svg`, `vercel.svg`).
   21 - `tests/`: Contains test files for the application.
   22     - `seo/`: Specific tests for SEO functionalities, e.g., `seo-validator.test.ts`.
   23 - `.github/workflows/`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows, such as `ci.yml` for continuous integration.
   24 - `middleware.ts`: Next.js middleware for handling internationalization and routing based on locales.
   25 - `next.config.mjs`: Next.js configuration file, including image optimization and security headers.
   26 - `postcss.config.mjs`: PostCSS configuration, primarily for Tailwind CSS.
   27 - `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration.
   28 - `lighthouserc.js`: Configuration for Lighthouse CI, used for performance, accessibility, and SEO audits.
   29
   30 ## Testing
   31 This project uses Jest, Playwright, and Cypress for quality assurance.
   32 - **Unit & Integration Tests:** While specific `npm run test:unit` or `npm run test:e2e` scripts are not
      explicitly defined in `package.json`, you can typically run tests using the respective test runners (e.g.,
      `jest`, `npx playwright test`, `npx cypress run`).
   33 - **SEO Audits:** Run Lighthouse checks using the configured `lighthouserc.js`. A common way to run this
      would be `npm run lighthouse` if a script is defined, or directly via Lighthouse CLI.
   34
   35 ## Deployment
   36 This Next.js application can be easily deployed to platforms like Vercel. Ensure all environment variables
      and build configurations are correctly set up for your chosen deployment platform.
