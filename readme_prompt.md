**AI Role:** You are an expert full-stack developer and technical writer specializing in Next.js.

**Project Context:**
The current working directory contains a complete Next.js application. The application was bootstrapped with `create-next-app` and is fully functional, running a development server via `npm run dev`. The goal is to create comprehensive documentation for developers who are new to the project.

**Primary Objective:**
Your task is to perform a thorough analysis of the entire codebase in the current directory. Based on this analysis, generate the complete content for a `README.md` file. The README should be clear, concise, and professionally formatted with Markdown.

**Analysis Checklist:**
Please analyze the following aspects of the codebase:
1.  **`package.json`:** Identify the project name, scripts (`dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`, `test`), and key dependencies (e.g., `next`, `react`, `typescript`, `tailwindcss`, `next-intl`, testing libraries).
2.  **Project Structure:** Map out the folder structure, paying special attention to `src/`, `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `public/`, and `styles/`. Explain the purpose of each main directory.
3.  **Configuration Files:** Detail the settings in `next.config.js` (including any plugins, image optimization, or redirects), `tsconfig.json` (for TypeScript settings), and `tailwind.config.ts` (if present).
4.  **Routing and Internationalization:** Describe the routing strategy (App Router vs. Pages Router). If internationalization is present (e.g., `next-intl`), explain how locales and translations are managed, including the middleware (`middleware.ts`).
5.  **Core Components & Pages:** Identify the main layout file (e.g., `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`) and the primary entry page (e.g., `app/[locale]/page.tsx`). Describe the purpose of key reusable components found in the `src/components` directory.
6.  **Testing Strategy:** Review the `tests/` directory and `package.json` to identify the testing frameworks in use (e.g., Jest, Playwright, Cypress) and explain how to run the tests.
7.  **SEO & Performance:** Look for SEO-related components (e.g., a `SEOHead` component), structured data implementation (`src/lib/seo`), and performance tools like Lighthouse (`lighthouserc.js`).

**Output Format:**
Generate a single, complete Markdown response that can be saved directly as a `README.md` file. The content should follow the structure below.

- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Internationalization:** Support for [List Languages] using `next-intl`
- **SEO:** Pre-configured for optimal search engine performance
- **Testing:** Comprehensive suite including [List testing frameworks]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd [PROJECT_NAME]
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

## Development Workflow
To start the local development server, run the following command:
npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application. The page will auto-update as you edit the files.

### Available Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Creates a production-ready build.
- `npm run start`: Starts the production server.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase for errors.

## Project Structure Explained
[Provide a summary of the project's file structure, explaining the purpose of key directories and files based on your analysis.]

## Testing
This project uses [Testing Frameworks] for quality assurance.
- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Run with `npm run test:unit`.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Run with `npm run test:e2e`.
- **SEO Audits:** Run Lighthouse checks with `npm run lighthouse`.
